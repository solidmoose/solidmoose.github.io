Hey folks, welcome to my new (and hopefully permanent) blog.
Unfortunately, I lost all the content from my old blog, so it looks like we're starting fresh.
It's been pretty discouraging since I don't quite have any ideas for posts, but I need something to get me started, so a welcome post will do for now.


Here you can expect to see projects I'm working on, life stories, games/books/shows I've been playing/reading/watching, etc. Or something like that. I don't know for sure, yet, but things will take form over time.
