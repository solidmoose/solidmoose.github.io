Well folks, over half a year later and I'm finally writing a real blog post. Ever since my first blog disappeared, I've been incredibly dismayed about maintaining a blog. I've totally lost my groove and I hardly have any ideas on what to write about, but hopefully soon, the creative juices will start flowing again. (This is basically what I said in my original post.)

Ideally, I would like this to be a development log for my projects. I suppose a good place to start is by relaying what I've been up to for the past year or so. 
This past summer, I managed to find a job. I had applied to many a company in search of an internship and got no response except for a rejection by Dolby. That didn't feel too good (makes me wonder what is required for a "good" candidate), but thankfully a biology lab on campus was looking for someone to work on a website over the summer.

I quickly applied and within a week, I was working. The last time I touched web development, I was still a kid. HTML & CSS have not changed a whole lot since then, but JS is a different story. I checked out the swathes of javascript frameworks in amazement - so many attempted solutions and yet no clear winner.

Anyway, the site didn't need a framework or anything, I was just curious to see what the state of web development in 2016 was. I quickly picked up on the project and things have been smooth sailing ever since. It's been a great learning experience, touching on PHP, SQL, HTML/CSS and a whole lot of JS.

Aside from that, I have been looking for a project to work on for a long while. I've always had a passion for gaming, so I've checked out a lot of game engines. Here are my thoughts on some of them:

- LOVE2D: lua is fun to write; absolutely no boilerplate; limited to 2D.
- Unreal: very heavy-duty; weird Blueprint-C++ limbo; not a lot of great resources or assets (in contrast to Unity's asset store); state-of-the-art graphics.
    - I really would like to build something with Unreal, but it's too daunting.
- Unity: basically the hobbyist's choice - great asset store; great resources; great capabilities.
- Godot: neat scene-based structure; uses what is essentially python; 2D and 3D capabilities.

I've come to terms with the fact that I won't be making anything in Unreal any time soon. Unity is way more accessible - it's lighterweight and has the asset store. Assets are part of the problem. I don't have great artistic skills, and making a game takes more art (including music) than it does code. Of course, there are free game assets out there, but the problem is creating a cohesive piece when you're pulling from multiple sources. I should just continue anyway, but I feel that graphics play a big role in making a game enjoyable.

I really would like to work on a project with someone, but so far I haven't found anyone to partner up with. There is a surprising lack of coding going on in my CS program, it would seem.

Anyway, that's it for now. I have a lot more to write (woo!), but I'll have to leave that for another post. Thanks for reading!
